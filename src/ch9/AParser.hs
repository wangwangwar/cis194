-- A parser for a value of type a is a function which takes a String
-- represnting the input to be parsed, and succeeds or fails; if it
-- succeeds, it returns the parsed value along with the remainder of
-- the input.
newtype Parser a = Parser { runParser :: String -> Maybe (a, String) }

-- For example, 'satisfy' takes a predicate on Char, and constructs a
-- parser which succeeds only if it sees a Char that satisfies the
-- predicate (which it then returns).  If it encounters a Char that
-- does not satisfy the predicate (or an empty input), it fails.
satisfy :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser Char
satisfy p = Parser f
  where
    f [] = Nothing    -- fail on the empty input
    f (x:xs)          -- check if x satisfies the predicate
                        -- if so, return x along with the remainder
                        -- of the input (that is, xs)
        | p x       = Just (x, xs)
        | otherwise = Nothing  -- otherwise, fail

-- Using satisfy, we can define the parser 'char c' which expects to
-- see exactly the character c, and fails otherwise.
char :: Char -> Parser Char
char c = satisfy (== c)

{- For example:

*Parser> runParser (satisfy isUpper) "ABC"
Just ('A',"BC")
*Parser> runParser (satisfy isUpper) "abc"
Nothing
*Parser> runParser (char 'x') "xyz"
Just ('x',"yz")

-- Exercise 1

-- First, youâ€™ll need to implement a Functor instance for Parser.
-- Hint: You may find it useful to implement a function
-- first :: (a -> b) -> (a,c) -> (b,c)

first :: (a -> b) -> (a, c) -> (b, c)
first f (a, c) = (f a, c)

  fmap f (Parser a) = Parser g
    where
      g s = case runParser (Parser a) s of
        Nothing -> Nothing
        Just (x, xs) -> Just $ first f (x, xs)

-- Exercise 2

-- implement an Applicative instance for Parser
--
-- 1. pure a represents the parser which consumes no input and successfully
-- returns a result of a.
--
-- 2. p1 <*> p2 represents the parser which first runs p1 (which will
-- consume some input and produce a function), then passes the
-- remaining input to p2 (which consumes more input and produces
-- some value), then returns the result of applying the function to the
-- value. However, if either p1 or p2 fails then the whole thing should
-- also fail (put another way, p1 <*> p2 only succeeds if both p1 and
-- p2 succeed).
instance Applicative Parser where
  pure a = Parser f
    where
      f _ = Just (a, [])

  p1 <*> p2 = Parser f
    where
      f s = case runParser p1 s of
        Nothing -> Nothing
        Just (x, xs) -> case runParser p2 xs of
          Nothing -> Nothing
          Just (y, ys) -> Just (x y, ys)
